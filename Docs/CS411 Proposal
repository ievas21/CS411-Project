Idea #1:Dining Hall Yelp
Similar to Yelp, designed specifically for the dining halls of BU. Students can log in to share photos of the food,
and let other users rate them. This way, we can assess the quality of the food without physically going to the dining hall, 
addressing the issues of inaccurate online menus and the absence of visual guides. This app would be able to serve the entire 
BU campus, and it would also inform the dining staff about the popular food items, enabling us to enhance dining hall 
offerings based on student preferences. 





Idea #2: Journaling Application
A personalized music experience that combines therapeutic aspects of journaling with the emotive power of music. 
Users write a diary entry or express their current mood, and an AI-powered tool analyzes the text to detect key emotions. 
Based on these emotions, the app generates a curated Spotify playlist that aligns with the userâ€™s feelings, complete with a 
creatively generated title.
